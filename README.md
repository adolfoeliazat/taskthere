## Features

* See a list of places
* Manually switch between active places
* See a list of tasks associated with a place
* Add/delete tasks
* Add/edit/delete places
* Places are stored with the current geolocation
* Fast

## To Do

* HTML5 application cache manifest (make it offline)
* Automatically switch places based on geolocation
* Controls for geolocation (toggle, update interval)
* Show geolocation info (maybe on hover)
* Remove jQuery dependency
* Package as W3C widget (`make widget`)

## Ideas

* Undo delete task
* Update an existing place to the current geolocation
* Show a dynamic / static Google map
* Optional due date / start date for tasks
* Optional tags / hierachy for tasks
* Grouping places (e.g. to places called "Superstore" have the same tasks)

## Design Goals

* UI should be easy to understand
* Should be quick to add tasks
* Should be very quick to delete tasks (use case: shopping list)
* Should look ok
* Should be a single page HTML document
* Work offline & without any server-side technology
* Should be usable as a mobile / desktop widget

## Non-goals

* Login or syncing between devices
* IE support
* Kitchen sink
